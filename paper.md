### Introduction

This paper will say things and those things will be interesting.

The interesting things in this article are more interesting than those in our last paper (Hmm et al 2004).

Who et al. (1998) have conducted several studies in this region, however none of them are interesting today.

We did this to push the forefront of interesting papers.

### Simulations

We simulated how interesting papers could be, using a random interest generator.

### Methodology

We compared our measurements of interestingness with a model simulation. The model is detailed in Smith et al. (2002).

### Results

In conclusion this is very interesting.

### Figures

Some interesting figures.

### Conclusions

We have learnt a lot haven't we.

### Acknowledgements
